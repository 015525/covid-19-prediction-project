# covid-19-prediction-project
A machine learning project that predicts the infection by corona virus with data-analysis for our dataset

# steps followed:-

.first of all we discover out data set, try to understand our columbs well
.check the missing values ,out liers and deal with them
.preprocess the data and see the correlations between our variables
.apply data analysis step
.conduct our conclusions and recomendations
.select best features to enter the model 
.then preprocess the data for the model (encoding the data , standardization, split data for training and testing)
.get results ,evaluate them using their accuracy 
.try to increase accuracy by parameter tunning or other stuff
.evaluate our project

# models performed :- A model for predicting infection by corona
                      A model to preidict death if infected
